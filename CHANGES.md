RELEASE 3.1  22/04/2014
-----------------------

If you are running ReportLab 3.0.x, the changes are minor.
   * support for emoji - characters outside the Unicode basic multilingual plane
   * improved pip-based installers will pull in all the needed dependencies; Pillow 2.4 appears to deal with all our issues.

RELEASE 3.0  14/02/2014
-----------------------

ReportLab 3.0 now supports Python 2.7, 3.3 and higher.	

There has been a substantial internal rewrite to ensure consistent use of unicode strings for
  natural-language text, and of bytes for all file format internals.  The intent
  is to make as few API changes as possible so that there should be little or no
  impact on users and their applications.  Changes are too numerous but can be
  seen on Bitbucket.

### Python 3.x compatibility
  * Python 3.x compatibility.  A single line of code should run on 2.7 and 3.3
  * __init__.py restricts to 2.7 or >=3.3
  * __init__.py allow the import of on optional reportlab.local_rl_mods to allow monkey patching etc.
  * rl_config now imports rl_settings & optionally local_rl_settings
  * ReportLab C extensions now live inside reportlab; _rl_accel is no longer required; All _rl_accel imports now 
	pass through reportlab.lib.rl_accel
  * xmllib is gone, alongside the paraparser stuff that caused issues in favour of HTMLParser.
  * some obsolete C extensions (sgmlop and pyHnj) are gone
  * Improved support for multi-threaded systems to the _rl_accel extension module.
  * Removed reportlab/lib/ para.py & pycanvas.py;  these would better belong in third party packages, 
	which can make use of the monkeypatching feature above.


### New features
  * Add ability to output greyscale and 1-bit PIL images without conversion to RGB. (contributed by Matthew Duggan)
  * highlight annotation (contributed by Ben Echols)

### Other
  * numerous very minor fixes, visible through BitBucket.


RELEASE 2.7  04/04/2013
-----------------------

#### Charts / graphics enhancements
  * Added SimpleTimeSeriesPlot
  * added _computeMaxSpace
  * added in lineStyle (for bars)
  * improved SVG rendering
  * Pie Chart now has an `innerRadiusFraction` to allow doughnut-like appearance for 2d charts	(it has no effect with 3d charts). 
	The separate 'doughnut' chart lacks many pie chart features and should only be used if you wanted multiple nested doughnuts. 

#### Charts/graphics bug fixes
  * piecharts.py: fix Pie3d __init__ to call its superclass
  * linecharts.py: fix swatch creation
  * fixed `y` axis in the simple time series plot

#### PDF
  * Fixes to testshapes & pdfform resetting
  * colors.py
  * various minor fixes

#### Platypus
  * Defined a small bullet rather than a big circle as the default for unordered lists
  * fixed attribute spelling bug
  * fixed CJK + endDots

### Acknowledgements
  Many thanks to Andrew Cutler, Dinu Gherman, Matthias Kirst and Stephan Richter for their contributions to this release.


RELEASE 2.6  27/09/2012
-----------------------

This is a minor release focusing mainly on improved documentation.	There are a 
number of minor enhancements, and a larger number of previous-undocumented
enhancements which we have documented better.

#### General changes
   * Manuals have been reformatted with more pleasing code snippets and tables of 
	 contents, and reviewed and expanded

#### Flowing documents (Platypus)
   * Added support for HTML-style list objects
   * Added flexible mechanism for drawing bullets
   * Allowed XPreformatted objects to use Asian line wrapping
   * Added an `autoNextPageTemplate` attribute to PageTemplates.  For example you 
	 can now set up a 'chapter first page template' which will always be followed
	 by a 'continuation template' on the next page break, saving the programmer from
	 having to issue control flow commands in the story.
   * added a TopPadder flowable, which will 'wrap' another Flowable and move it 
	 to the bottom of the current page.  
   * More helpful error messages when large tables cannot be rendered
   * Documentation for images within text (`test_032_images`)
   * Trailing dots for use on contents pages

#### Charts and graphics
   * Support for UPCA bar codes
   * We now have a semi-intelligent system for labelling pie charts with 
	 callout lines.  Thanks to James Martin-Collar, a maths student at Warwick 
	 University, who did this as his summer internship.
   * Axes - added startOffset and endOffset properties; allowed for axis 
	 background annotations.
   * Bar charts - allow more control of z Index (i.e. drawing order of axes and
	 lines)
   * Pie charts - fixed bugs in 3d appearance
   * SVG output back end has seen some bugs fixed and now outputs resizeable SVG

RELEASE 2.5  at 18:00 GMT  01/Oct/2010
--------------------------------------

Many new features have been added and numerous bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to everybody who has contributed to the open-source toolkit in
the run-up to the 2.5 release, whether by reporting bugs, sending patches,
or contributing to the reportlab-users mailing list.
Major contributors are credited in the user documentation.

   * Support for colour separated PDF output and other optimisations and
	 features for high-quality printing, including enforcement of colour
	 models for CMYK, RGB, and "spot colours"
   * Long table optimisations are now turned on by default.  Previously,
	 documents with very long tables spanning many pages could take a long
	 time to create because we considered the whole table to work out row
	 and column sizes.	A patch was submitted some time ago to fix this
	 controlled by a flag in the rl_config file, but this was set 'off'
	 for compatibility.  Users are often not aware of this and we haven't
	 found any real-world cases where the new layout technique works badly,
	 so we are turning this behaviour on.
   * New support for QR barcodes - [try our demo!](https://www.reportlab.com/demos/qr/)

   * Colour separation and other enhancements for high-end print
   * Python 2.7 support

#### Charts

### Unicode support

This is the Big One, and the reason some apps may break. You must now pass in 
text either in UTF-8 or as unicode string objects. The library will handle 
everything to do with output encoding. There is more information on this below.

Since this is the biggest change, we'll start by reviewing how it worked in the 
past. In ReportLab 1.x, any string input you passed to our APIs was supposed to 
be in the same encoding as the font you selected for output. If using the 
default fonts in Acrobat Reader (Helvetica/Times/Courier), you would have 
implicitly used WinAnsi encoding, which is almost exactly the same as Latin-1. 
However, if using TrueType fonts, you would have been using UTF-8. For Asian 
fonts, you had a wide choice of encodings but had to specify which one (e.g 
Shift-JIS or EUC for Japanese). This state of affairs meant that you had to 
make sure that every piece of text input was in the same encoding as the font 
used to display it.

With ReportLab 2, none of that necessary. Instead:

Here is what's different now:

#### Input text encoding is UTF-8 or Python Unicode strings

  Any text you pass to a canvas API (drawString etc.), Paragraph or other 
  flowable constructor, into a table cell, or as an attribute of a graphic (e.g. 
  chart.title.text), is supposed to be unicode. If you use a traditional Python 
  string, it is assumed to be UTF-8. If you pass a Unicode object, we know it's 
  unicode. 

#### Font encodings

  Fonts still work in different ways, and the built-in ones will still use 
  WinAnsi or MacRoman internally while TrueType will use UTF-8. However, the 
  library hides this from you; it converts as it writes out the PDF file. As 
  before, it's still your job to make sure the font you use has the characters 
  you need, or you may get either a traceback or a visible error character. 
  Asian CID fonts

  You no longer need to specify the encoding for the built-in Asian fonts, 
  just the face name. ReportLab knows about the standard fonts in Adobe's Asian 
  Language Packs. 

#### Asian Truetype fonts

  The standard Truetype fonts differ slightly for Asian languages (e.g 
  msmincho.ttc). These can now be read and used, albeit somewhat inefficiently. 
  Asian word wrapping

  Previously we could display strings in Asian languages, but could not 
  properly wrap paragraphs as there are no gaps between the words. We now have a 
  basic word wrapping algorithm.

#### unichar tag

  A convenience tag, <unichar/> has also been added. You can now do <unichar 
  code="0xfc"/> or <unichar name='LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS'/> and get 
  a lowercase u umlaut. Names should be those in the Unicode Character Database.
  Accents, Greeks and symbols

  The correct way to refer to all non-ASCII characters is to use their 
  unicode representation. This can be literal Unicode or UTF-8. Special symbols 
  and Greek letters (collectively, "greeks") inserted in paragraphs using the 
  greek tag (e.g. <greek>lambda</greek>) or using the entity references (e.g. 
  &lambda;) are now processed in a different way than in version 1. Previously, 
  these were always rendered using the Zapf Dingbats font. Now they are always 
  output in the font you specified, unless that font does not support that 
  character. If the font does not support the character, and the font you 
  specified was an Adobe Type 1 font, Zapf Dingbats is used as a fallback. 
  However, at present there is no fallback in the case of TTF fonts. Note that 
  this means that documents that contain greeks and specify a TTF font may need 
  changing to explicitly specify the font to use for the greek character, or you 
  will see a black square in place of that character when you view your PDF 
  output in Acrobat Reader.

### Other New Features

#### PDF

  * Improved low-level annotation support for PDF "free text annotations"
	FreeTextAnnotation allows showing and hiding of an arbitrary PDF "form" 
	(reusable chunk of PDF content) depending on whether the document is printed or 
	viewed on-screen, or depending on whether the mouse is hovered over the 
	content, etc.
  * TTC font collection files are now readable:
	ReportLab now supports using TTF fonts packaged in .TTC files
  * East Asian font support (CID and TTF):
	You no longer need to specify the encoding for the built-in Asian 
	fonts, just the face name. ReportLab knows about the standard fonts in Adobe's 
	Asian Language Packs. 
  * Native support for JPEG CMYK images:
	ReportLab now takes advantage of PDF's native JPEG CMYK image support, 
	so that JPEG CMYK images are no longer (lossily) converted to RGB format before 
	including them in PDF. 

#### Platypus

  * Link support in paragraphs:
	Platypus paragraphs can now contain link elements, which support both 
	internal links to the same PDF document, links to other local PDF documents, 
	and URL links to pages on the web. Some examples:

	Web links::

		<link href="http://www.reportlab.com/">ReportLab<link>

	Internal link to current PDF document::

		<link href="summary">ReportLab<link>

	External link to a PDF document on the local filesystem::

		<link href="pdf:c:/john/report.pdf">ReportLab<link>

  * Improved wrapping support:
	Support for wrapping arbitrary sequence of flowables around an image, 
	using reportlab.platypus.flowables.ImageAndFlowables (similar to 
	ParagraphAndImage).
  * `KeepInFrame`:
	Sometimes the length of a piece of text you'd like to include in a 
	fixed piece of page "real estate" is not guaranteed to be constrained to a 
	fixed maximum length. In these cases, KeepInFrame allows you to specify an 
	appropriate action to take when the text is too long for the space allocated 
	for it. In particular, it can shrink the text to fit, mask (truncate) 
	overflowing text, allow the text to overflow into the rest of the document, or 
	raise an error.
  * Improved convenience features for inserting unicode symbols and other 
  characters:
	`<unichar/>` lets you conveniently insert unicode characters using the 
	standard long name or code point. Characters inserted with the `<greek>` tags 
	(e.g. `<greek>lambda</greek>`) or corresponding entity references (e.g. &lambda;) 
	support arbitrary fonts (rather than only Zapf Dingbats).
  * Table spans and splitting improved:
	Cell spanning in tables used to go wrong sometimes when the table split 
	over a page. We believe this is improved, although there are so many table 
	features that it's hard to define correct behaviour in all cases.
  * `KeepWithNext` improved:
	Paragraph styles have long had an attribute keepWithNext, but this was 
	buggy when set to True. We believe this is fixed now. keepWithNext is important 
	for widows and orphans control; you typically set it to True on headings, to 
	ensure at least one paragraph appears after the heading and that you don't get 
	headings alone at the bottom of a column. 

#### Graphics
  * Barcodes:
	The barcode package has been added to the standard reportlab 
	toolkit distribution (it used to live separately in our contributions area). It 
	has also seen fairly extensive reworking for production use in a recent 
	project. These changes include adding support for the standard European EAN 
	barcodes (EAN 8 and EAN13).
  * Improvements to Legending:
	Instead of manual placement, there is now a attachment point (N, 
	S, E, W, etc.), so that the legend is always automatically positioned correctly 
	relative to the chart. Swatches (the small sample squares of colour / pattern 
	fill sometimes displayed in the legend) can now be automatically created from 
	the graph data. Legends can now have automatically-computed totals (useful for 
	financial applications).
  * More and better ways to place piechart labels:
	New smart algorithms for automatic pie chart label positioning 
	have been added. You can now produce nice-looking labels without manual 
	positioning even for awkward cases in big runs of charts.
  * Adjustable piechart slice ordering:
	For example. pie charts with lots of small slices can be 
	configured to alternate thin and thick slices to help the label placement 
	algorithm work better.
  * Improved spiderplots

#### Noteworthy bug fixes
  * Fixes to TTF splitting (patch from Albertas Agejevas):
	This affected some documents using font subsetting
  * Tables with spans improved splitting:
	Splitting of tables across pages did not work correctly when the table had
	row/column spans
  * Fix runtime error affecting keepWithNext
