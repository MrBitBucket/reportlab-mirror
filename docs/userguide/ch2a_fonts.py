heading1("Fonts and encodings")

disc("""
This chapter covers fonts, encodings and Asian language capabilities.
If you are purely concerned with generating PDFs for Western
European languages, you can just read the "Unicode is the default" section
below and skip the rest on a first reading.
We expect this section to grow considerably over time. We
hope that Open Source will enable us to give better support for
more of the world's languages than other tools, and we welcome
feedback and help in this area.
""")

heading2("Unicode and UTF8 are the default input encodings")

disc("""
Starting with reportlab Version 2.0 (May 2006), all text input you
provide to our APIs should be in UTF8 or as Python Unicode objects.
This applies to arguments to canvas.drawString and related APIs,
table cell content, drawing object parameters, and paragraph source
text.  
""")


disc("""
We considered making the input encoding configurable or even locale-dependent,
but decided that "explicit is better than implicit".""")

disc("""
This simplifies many things we used to do previously regarding greek
letters, symbols and so on.  To display any character, find out its
unicode code point, and make sure the font you are using is able
to display it.""")

disc("""
If you are adapting a ReportLab 1.x application, or reading data from
another source which contains single-byte data (e.g. latin-1 or WinAnsi),
you need to do a conversion into Unicode.  The Python codecs package now
includes converters for all the common encodings, including Asian ones.
""")



disc(u"""
If your data is not encoded as UTF8, you will get a UnicodeDecodeError as
soon as you feed in a non-ASCII character.  For example, this snippet below is
attempting to read in and print a series of names, including one with a French
accent:  ^Marc-Andr\u00e9 Lemburg^.  The standard error is quite helpful and tells you
what character it doesn't like:
""")

eg(u"""

The simplest fix is just to convert your data to unicode, saying which encoding
it comes from, like this:""")

...     c.drawString(100, y, uniLine.strip())

""")


heading2("Automatic output font substitution")

disc("""
There are still a number of places in the code, including the rl_config
defaultEncoding parameter, and arguments passed to various Font constructors,
which refer to encodings.  These were useful in the past when people needed to
use glyphs in the Symbol and ZapfDingbats fonts which are supported by PDF
viewing devices.

By default the standard fonts (Helvetica, Courier, Times Roman)
will offer the glyphs available in Latin-1.  However, if our engine detects
a character not in the font, it will attempt to switch to Symbol or ZapfDingbats to
display these.   For example, if you include the Unicode character for a pair of 
right-facing scissors, \\u2702, in a call to ^drawString^, you should see them (there is
an example in ^test_pdfgen_general.py/pdf^).  It is not
necessary to switch fonts in your code.

""")


heading2("Using non-standard Type 1 fonts")

disc("""
As discussed in the previous chapter, every copy of Acrobat Reader
comes with 14 standard fonts built in.  Therefore, the ReportLab
PDF Library only needs to refer to these by name.  If you want
to use other fonts, they must be available to your code and
will be embedded in the PDF document.""")

disc("""
You can use the mechanism described below to include arbitrary
fonts in your documents. We have an open source
font named <i>DarkGardenMK</i> which we may
use for testing and/or documenting purposes (and which you may
use as well). It comes bundled with the ReportLab distribution in the
directory $reportlab/fonts$.
""")

disc("""
Right now font-embedding relies on font description files in the Adobe
AFM ('Adobe Font Metrics') and PFB ('Printer Font Binary') format. The
former is an ASCII file and contains information about the characters
('glyphs') in the font such as height, width, bounding box info and
other 'metrics', while the latter is a binary file that describes the
shapes of the font. The $reportlab/fonts$ directory contains the files
$'DarkGardenMK.afm'$ and $'DarkGardenMK.pfb'$ that are used as an example
font.
""")

disc("""
In the following example locate the folder containing the test font and
register it for future use with the $pdfmetrics$ module,
after which we can use it like any other standard font.

it's to say which set of characters within the font file will be active

disc("""
The font's facename comes from the AFM file's $FontName$ field.
In the example above we knew the name in advance, but quite
often the names of font description files are pretty cryptic
and then you might want to retrieve the name from an AFM file
automatically.
When lacking a more sophisticated method you can use some
code as simple as this:

In the <i>DarkGardenMK</i> example we explicitely specified
the place of the font description files to be loaded.
In general, you'll prefer to store your fonts in some canonic
locations and make the embedding mechanism aware of them.
Using the same configuration mechanism we've already seen at the
beginning of this section we can indicate a default search path
for Type-1 fonts.
""")

disc("""
Unfortunately, there is no reliable standard yet for such
locations (not even on the same platform) and, hence, you might
have to edit one of the files $reportlab_settings.py$ or $~/.reportlab_settings$ to modify the
value of the $T1SearchPath$ identifier to contain additional
directories.  Our own recommendation is to use the ^reportlab/fonts^
folder in development; and to have any needed fonts as packaged parts of
your application in any kind of controlled server deployment.  This insulates
you from fonts being installed and uninstalled by other software or system
administrator.

the font designer has provided all the needed glyphs.  However,
this is not always true.  In the case of our example font,
the letters of the alphabet are present, but many symbols and
accents are missing.  The default behaviour is for the font to
print a 'notdef' character - typically a blob, dot or space -
when passed a character it cannot draw.  However, you can ask
the library to warn you instead; the code below (executed
before loading a font) will cause warnings to be generated
for any glyphs not in the font when you register it.""")
