The utils module is intended for non distribution stuff eg cvs_check.py.
To run the daily script you need a .cvspass entry for cvs1:/cvsroot/reportlab.

I have instituted a daily crontab job on sourceforge. Each day around 5 am VA Linux time (I
think it's PST) we build two files in our FTP area called current.tgz & current.zip. These are
intended as source archives and have the CVS dirs removed.

The script used for the daily run is utils/daily.py. It can also be used with
a release argument (the tag to be used).

ie to create current.tgz & current.zip in /home/groups/ftp/pub/reportlab
	python daily.py

to create reportlab_yyyymmdd.zip/.tgz in /home/groups/ftp/pub/reportlab as a release
with tag TTT
	python daily.py -release TTT

The files current.zip/.tgz and reportlab.zip/.tgz will then be linked to the created files.

I don't know enough yet, but Cyclops looks like a really great tool.

The utils/runtests.py script has a command line like

   python runtests.py [options]

    option
    -help           print this message and exit
    -dir path       directory to test default /tmp/reportlab_test/reportlab
    -cycles[=flags] check for cycles using Tim Peter's Cyclops cycle finder
                    flags=s(tats), a(rcs), C(omponents), c(ycles), o(bjects)
    -notest         don't carry out tests
    -clean          cleanup if no errors
    -fclean         cleanup even if some errors occur

As there were a fair number of problems, I am looking at the output of
	python runtests.py -dir \python\reportlab -cycles=s


Release Procedure
0) ensure you have an up-to-date working copy of ReportLab.

1) edit reportlab/__init__.py and insert the new version number d.xy

2) 2001-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" -r >/tmp/logh
   to get a list of the latest changes. The date & time should correspond to
   the previous release. Add the changes into the reportlab changes file at
   the top. These changes should probably be trimmed.
   
3)	Commit the alterations to __init__.py and changes

4)	Assign a release tag to the repository for us this is done in a working
	copy of ReportLab using
		cvs -z3 tag ReportLab_d_xy
	where d.xy was the version number entered into __init__.py

	If you need to tag the repository in www.reportlab.co.uk it is possible
		a)	make a dir work
		b)	cd work
		c)	mkdir CVS
		d)	cd CVS
		e)	create Entries as empty
		f)	create Root as :pserver:robin@www.reportlab.co.uk:/rl_home/repository
		g)	create Repository as /rl_home/repository/
		h)	cd ..
			cvs -z3 upd -A -P -d to create a working copy
		i)	cvs -z3 tag ReportLab_x_yz

	alternatively log in to co.uk and do an rtag command on the actual repository.

	If there are problems and you need to go back to step 1 and restart it mey be useful
	to know that you can add a -F to the tag command to allow you to retag a modified
	source file ie cvs -z3 tag -F ReportLab_d_xy

5)	Login to Yosemite.
	Run batch script c:\SCRIPTS\ReportLabRelease.bat d_xy

	Login to qs385.pair.com

	cd bin
	./ReportLabRelease d_xy

	this should create the files
		~/public_ftp/www_reportlab_com/ReportLab_d_xy.tgz/.zip
	the links ~/public_ftp/www_reportlab_org/reportlab.tgz/.zip should be pointing to the 
	new archives.

	If we know that the idle py2pdf patch works
	./daily.py -py2pdf to create the cutdown distribution for idle

6)	Finally we need to edit ~/public_html/news.txt add the appropriate
	story at the top.

	Then commit the changes using cvs -z3 commit -m "Release x_yz" news.txt
	and make the html correct using "./prep.py" (in the public_html directory).

7)	Optional announcements made to clp, reportlab-users, reportlab-team

8)	Upload the .tgz and .zip files to sourcforge. I log in to qs385 and then 
	cd public_ftp/www_reportlab_com 
	ftp upload.sourceforge.net
	 cd incoming
	 send ReportLab_x_yz.tgz
	 send ReportLab_x_yz.zip
	 quit
	
	Now login to SF change to the reportlab project page
	https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=682
	hit add release to start adding the new release

	the new release name is x.yz and the package name is reportlab

	When the add files etc page comes up add some suitable change/announcement
	words and then make sure that all the files are present and added.
	To make sure the files will be visible you must first add and then edit them at the bottom
	of the page. Ensure processor is any, file type is source .zip or source .gz and that the
	filename and package are set appropriately. If any of the fields are unset then the file won't
	show up in the downlaod area.
